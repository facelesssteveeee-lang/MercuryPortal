  <h1>English 8: Quarter 2, Lesson 1 (Week 1)</h1>
  <h2>Evaluating Persuasive Texts</h2>

  <p><b>Main Goal</b></p>
  <p>This lesson helps you become a better reader by teaching you how to analyze persuasive texts. By learning to tell the difference between facts and opinions and understanding different types of claims, you can identify bias and evaluate the strength of an argument.</p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  
  <h3>1. Facts vs. Opinions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Fact:</b> A statement that is verifiable or can be proven true. It can be confirmed in a reference source like an encyclopedia, dictionary, or a map.
      <ul>
        <li>Example of a Fact: The Philippines is an archipelago composed of over 7,600 islands.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Opinion:</b> A belief, judgment, or personal viewpoint that cannot be proven.
      <ul>
        <li>Example of an Opinion: Adobo is the best Filipino dish.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>How to tell the difference:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Look for words that express extreme positives or negatives (everyone, never, always, best, worst). These often signal an opinion.</li>
        <li>Descriptive words can be subjective. For example, "a beautiful painting" is an opinion because "beautiful" is a personal judgment.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>2. Types of Claims</h3>
  <p>A claim is the main argument an author is trying to make in a persuasive text. There are three main types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Claim of Fact:</b> An assertion that something is or is not true. These claims are based on facts and can be debated or argued.
      <ul>
        <li>Example: Climate change is caused by human activity.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Claim of Value:</b> An assertion that something is good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral. These claims are based on personal values and beliefs.
      <ul>
        <li>Example: It is wrong to cheat on a test.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Claim of Policy:</b> An assertion that a specific action should or should not be taken. These claims often use words like should, ought to, or must.
      <ul>
        <li>Example: The government should provide free healthcare for all citizens.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Types of Evidence</h2>
  <p>To make a claim stronger, an author uses evidence.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Self-Evidence:</b> A statement that is obviously true and needs no further proof.</li>
    <li><b>Anecdotal Evidence:</b> Evidence based on a personal story or a single, specific example. It is often used to make an argument relatable but may not be reliable for a larger conclusion.</li>
    <li><b>Argument from Authority:</b> Evidence based on the opinion of an expert or a respected person.</li>
    <li><b>Empirical Evidence:</b> Evidence that is based on scientific observation, data, and research. This is generally considered the strongest type of evidence.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Summary of Skills</h2>
  <p>By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tell the difference between facts and opinions.</li>
    <li>Identify examples of facts and opinions in a persuasive text.</li>
    <li>Find the main idea of a persuasive text.</li>
    <li>Recognize the supporting details that help make the main idea clear.</li>
    <li>Differentiate between a claim of fact, claim of value, and claim of policy.</li>
  </ul>
