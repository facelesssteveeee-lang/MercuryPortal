                <h3>1. Simplifying Rational Algebraic Expressions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To reduce a rational algebraic expression to its simplest form.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process:</strong> The simplification process involves three main steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Factoring:</strong> Completely factor both the numerator and the denominator of the rational expression.</li>
                            <li><strong>Identifying Common Factors:</strong> Determine any common factors that are common to both the numerator and the denominator.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dividing Out Common Factors:</strong> Divide out both the numerator and the denominator by their common factors.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Important Concepts:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Completely Factored:</strong> An expression is completely factored when all its factors are prime and can no longer be broken down into simpler factors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Simplest Form:</strong> A rational algebraic expression is in its simplest form when the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.</li>
                            <li><strong>Restricted Values:</strong> These are values of the variable that would make the denominator equal to zero. These values are excluded from the domain of the expression.</li>
                            <li><strong>Domain:</strong> The set of all allowable values of the variable for which the expression is defined.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
